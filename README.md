I'm a software developer who has recently made the transition to tech, after playing professional football for the last seven years. I'm a self-motivated, team oriented, algorithmic thinker with a passion for learning and a strength for working in a high pressure, fast-paced, environment. I'm accustomed to comprehending a variety of new concepts in a short period of time and seeking a position to expand and leverage my strengths.
